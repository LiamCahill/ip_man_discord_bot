This repo contains the source code for Ip Man, a Discord program designed to help managed Inspiration Points for my DnD campaign.

Technologies I expect to use are:
    1. Python
    2. Webhooks
    3. Google Drive, specifically Google Sheets, which will function as the database.
    4. Chat GPT, for reference, examples, etc.
